# Micro-Fiber Project Presentation

## Overview

Micro-Fiber is a lightweight microservice framework built on top of [GoFiber](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber), designed to streamline the development of production-ready Go microservices. It offers an opinionated project structure, pre-configured middleware, and CLI tooling to accelerate development while maintaining flexibility and performance.

## Key Features

- **High Performance**: Leverages GoFiber's fast HTTP engine for minimal overhead.
- **Structured Project Layout**: Provides a consistent, scalable structure for microservices.
- **Built-in Middleware**: Includes logging, JWT authentication, CORS, and error handling.
- **CLI Tooling**: Simplifies code generation for resources, migrations, and more.
- **Production-Ready**: Supports observability, testing, and easy deployment.

## Why Micro-Fiber?

- **Developer Productivity**: Reduces boilerplate with CLI tools and a clear project structure.
- **Scalability**: Designed for building modular, maintainable microservices.
- **Extensibility**: Easily integrate custom middleware and external packages.
- **Community-Driven**: Open-source with opportunities for contributions.

## Use Cases

- Building RESTful APIs for microservice architectures.
- Rapid prototyping of backend services.
- Developing scalable, production-grade applications with minimal setup.
