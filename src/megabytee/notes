Notes files to help understand my project structure.

#src/assets : svg,png,jpeg.. media asset folder.

#src/components : react,vue,.. for external ui framwork components

#src/layouts : for astro layouts

#src/lib : for external lib utils integrations.

#src/pages : for astro route pages.

#src/styles : for css styles.

#src/megabytee : in this dir i structure all the api,components,data,pages that i will use on this project.

++api : libs that connect with external apis to fetch data.
++components : astro components only.
++data : static data folder
++pages : contains astro index page components in this way i let /src/pages for routes with clean code have only layout, some params, and the index page component.

=>example check this to understand:
src/pages/index.astro (this is landing page)

src/megabytee/pages/landing.astro

in this way of structure i keep the project struct well organized and clean.
